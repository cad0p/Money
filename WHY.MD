Aggregation of payments, a way to make small transactions sustainable.

At least in Italy, to make payments of less than 10 euros I challenge anyone to try to use the card having success. All sellers complain about commissions that make payments below a certain threshold unsustainable.

A buyer-seller transaction has two types of commissions, both of which are paid by the seller: fixed and variable. We can optimistically approximate the fixed commission to € 0.1 per transaction, while the percentage commission on the amount transacted is 2%. In reality the commissions are very unclear and depend very much on how much money a store moves. In essence, small shops probably pay worse percentages than very large companies.

What possible solution? In addition to begging the banks to eliminate bank charges below a certain threshold, of course. Among other things, it would also benefit them, because the volume of transactions made with the card would increase not a little.
A way to convince them? Try to create a service that groups the transactions to minimize fixed costs.
With random transactions from 1 to 10 euros, at present the fixed commissions would have the same weight as the variable ones, having as a final result a doubling of the commissions on the total amount, going from 2 to 4%!
If all transactions were from one euro, the fixed part would even represent 10%, bringing the total to 12% of commissions, meaning that the trader would only have 88% of the proceeds.

How is this service articulated?
When a transaction is made, the transaction does not take place on the spot. A virtual transaction occurs in the system. Afterwards the buyer will definitely go to another store to make another small payment. Think for example of things like taking a sandwich for lunch, or buying the newspaper at the newsstand, or even having a coffee. When it has reached the amount requested by the seller, if in the meantime the seller has received as much money from these virtual micropayments made by other buyers, then the transaction will take place between the first buyer (if he was the fastest among the buyers to reach that figure) and the seller. With this system it has been tested that you could halve the number of transactions (and therefore halve the fixed cost) made for the same volume of money transferred (eg 770 transactions instead of 1800 for a volume of 10000 euros on payments from 1 to 10 euros ) even just putting the buffer, or the minimum transfer amount required by the seller, at € 10.

Nice, it could work! But how to bring all those people into this service?
There would be several ways to develop it, but the most compelling would most likely be that of easier and faster adoption, ie the one that requires the least possible steps to function.
The method that requires fewer steps would work like this:
The shopkeeper has joined the service simply by connecting the POS to the system, which could work on the cash desk computer or even on the mobile phone (often the POS can be controlled remotely). At this point he will put a sticker to promote that in his shop you can pay with the card even for amounts less than 10 euros.
The customer enters, and, informed of the fact, pays with the card normally. Now the POS control comes into play: the payment is suspended, a bit like when you insert the card at the gas station before filling up, or when you give the card (abroad) to the restaurant before tip, or when you buy something on Amazon (the amount is not immediately charged), or always on Amazon when you book an item not yet available.
The transaction is recorded in the system as a virtual transaction (therefore waiting to be executed), and in it the data of the buyer and the seller are stored.
As soon as the conditions for making the payment of the minimum amount decided by the seller are favorable, then a real transaction is executed, and the amount of the transaction is deducted from the situation of the buyer and the seller.

This would be an opportunity to implement the electronic receipt too!
The buyer would then be encouraged to download the application, in which he will be able to see the history of his purchases and have a copy of the receipt, always present and above all that does not fade, solving another big problem of today's transactions. Obviously if you prefer, the buyer can then use the app to pay, but using an online payment, not physically with the POS of the shop.
